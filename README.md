Recreating the deep reinforcment learning Twin Delayed DDPG. 

The paper for the model is: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09477.pdf

Recreated the model by following along to the Udemy Course: Artificial Intelligence 2.0: AI, Python, DRL + ChatGPT Prize by Hadelin de Ponteves. The link to the course is: https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning/.

The attached mp4 file is the result of training the network on the ant environment within the openai library. The trained weights have been attached as well.
